Throughout graduate school, I have contributed to our wonderful chemical engineering community in several ways. For two years in a row, I was selected to be a graduate student peer mentor. In this role, I led weekly classes for 6  - 7 first year students to help prepare them for their Doctoral Candidacy Exam. In the image below, my group is celebrating the Lunar New Year!

Outside of mentoring, I was an active member on the ChE diversity, equity, and inclusion curriculum team. Here, I develop new homework lessons that incorporated lessons on the broader societal impacts of chemical engineering, while still testing rigorous technical concepts. As an initial team member, I was responsible for developing homework sets for the undergraduate fluid mechanics course. The success of this initiative has led to new departmental funding for this team. If you are curious about this initiative, please reach out. I would be happy to share our problem sets. 

I have held several other hats, including outreach chair of the chemical engineering graduate society, and the recruitment chair!
